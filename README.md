# RES_EU_2015_2019

The DATASET folder provides CSV files containing input data of the criteria by which the alternatives are evaluated for 2015 - 2019. The data are divided into absolute and relative for both models presented in the paper. The data were derived from the EUROSTAT database.

The RESULTS folder includes the final results represented by preference values and rankings for the V-COMET and referential MCDA methods for 2015 - 2019 for the absolute and relative model.

The software folder contains an implementation of the V-COMET method in Python and an implementation of applying the introduced method to the data of the RES evaluation problem, which is the focus of this paper.
